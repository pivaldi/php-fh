#+title: PHP Functions Highlighter for Emacs

Provide font highlighting of all PHP functions within =php-mode= for Emacs.

* Installation

** From Melpa

This package is not part of Melpa for now, waiting for maturity…

** Manually

This package requires that the [[https://github.com/emacs-php/php-mode][php-mode]] package was installed.

To install =php-fh=, place/clone the =php-fh= directory in a
directory of your choice, add it to your load path and require
=php-fh= writing this code in your Emacs configuration file (=.emacs= ?) :

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (add-to-list 'load-path "/place/where/you/put/php-fh")
    (require 'php-fh)
#+END_SRC

Either evaluate both statements with =C-x C-e=, or restart /Emacs/.

* Usage

=(eval-after-load 'php-mode '(php-fh-highlight))=

* Customisable variables

- =php-fh-user-functions-name= : list of PHP user defined functions that
  =php-fh= must also highlight.
- =php-fh-php-cmd= : The PHP command.
